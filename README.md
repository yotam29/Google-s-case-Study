# Google's Case Study - Bike Share Analysis

## Introduction

Google's Bike Share Analysis is a data analysis project that aims to gain insights and make data-driven decisions based on bike share data from multiple cities. The project utilizes R programming language and various libraries such as dplyr, ggplot2, and sqldf for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. The dataset contains information about bike rides, ride duration, ride frequency, member types, and other relevant metrics. The goal is to provide meaningful visualizations and analysis better to understand bike share usage patterns and user behaviors.

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, data type conversions, and other data quality issues.
- Data Visualization: Various visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and line charts, are used to present the data and analysis results in an understandable format.
- Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics and aggregations are performed to uncover the dataset's patterns, trends, and insights.
- Pie Charts: Pie charts represent the distribution of bike ride distribution between members and casual users.
- Bar Charts: Bar charts showcase the average ride distance for each member type.
- Line Charts: Line charts demonstrate the usage patterns of bike rides across different days of the week for each member type.

## Technologies Used

- R Programming Language: The primary language for data analysis and visualization.
- R Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, sqldf, and other R packages used for data manipulation and visualization.
